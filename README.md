# Object Oriented Programming- Real world examples
The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

- 4 Pillar of OOPs:
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritence 

<ins>ENCAPSULATION</ins> : 
Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions under a single unit called class and it helps in data hiding.
- Suppose you go to an automatic cola vending machine and request for a cola. The machine processes your request and gives the cola.  
- Here automatic cola vending machine is a **class**. It contains both data i.e. Cola can and operations i.e. service mechanism and they are wrapped/integrated under a single unit Cola Vending Machine. This is called **Encapsulation**.  
- You can interact with cola can only through service mechanism. You cannot access the details about internal data like how much cans it contains, mechanism etc. This is **Data Hiding**.

<ins>ABSTRACTION</ins> : 
Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.  
- A man is driving a car, the man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what **abstraction** is.

<ins>POLYMORPHISM</ins> : 
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. 
- A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called **polymorphism**.
